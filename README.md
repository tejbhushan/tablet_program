# tablet_program
Simple tablet program in C Language using Graphics (graphics.h).

This was my project in Computer Graphics course.
There are 3 files - main_layout.c, 2_cars_game.h and stick_hero_game.h.
The above .h files are the user defined header files called from the .c file. Since I used the Turbo C compiler while building this the program structure will be in old fashion.
Copy paste the main_layout.c in turboC/bin directory and the other 2 .h files in turboC/header directory.
 

To compile and Run - 
Do regular run of .c file.

Instructions Inside - 
Click on the center below circle - which is our APPS Menu.
there you can slide left/right by the mouse on output window to access 2 App windows.
Right click on the Red color Rectangle which is the link for 2 Cars game app. Inside 2 cars game, you will have your screen divided into 2 vertical parts. Both the sides we will have a car (rectangle shaped). Press key 'a' and 'd' for left side car to move to left or right and similarly for the right side car keys are 'j'and 'l'. Keys are case sensitive.
The cars will move ahead and you have to simultanously collect the circular points on your way for both the cars.
To end the game press 'e'.
Play and let me your high score.

Similarly some fixes is required to run the other stick_hero_game.h by clicking the blue rectangle on the first app window.
Small fix in stick_hero_game.h. Still requires more fixes.
Definitely enjoyable
